Warrior...
I am a part of you. I see what fate has befallen us.
The sacred gem has been destroyed. The link between it and our world torn in two.
The gem which preserved our night and our day has torn asunder.
We call upon you to save us and save yourself. \nSeek the west and find your fate. \nSeek the east and find your legacy.
Will you recover the balance of the shards or do you choose to let all fall into darkness?",
It is you who must decide, and us who must accept the fate.
